"urls":
    Specifies the starting URLs of all other web pages that 
    are in the app. In this example, both
    http://mysubdomain.example.com/page1.html and
    http://mysubdomain.example.com/subdir/page2.html 
    would be in the app. You don't need to specify the URLs
    for included files or for assets such as images. 
    Currently, the domain name must be followed by at least 
    one character ("/").
